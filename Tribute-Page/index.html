                Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.

                    Bell Labs removes themselves from the Multics OS project that Ritchie and Thompson were working on. Ritchie aided Thompson in producing this single-memory OS.
                    Starts work on UNIX.
                    Ritchie noted:
                    <p class = "italic"><i>
                            "It began in 1969 when Ken Thompson discovered a little-used PDP-7 computer and set out to fashion a computing environment that he liked. Thompson wrote the first version of Unix for a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 in a month, using a cross-assembler that ran on GECOS. The PDP-7 he used had 4K of 18-bit words. His work soon attracted me; I joined in the enterprise, though most of the ideas, and most of the work for that matter, were his."

                </li>
                <br>

                    Recieved the ACM A.M. Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and the "Nobel Prize of computing" for their work in UNIX and general operating system.
                    The Turing Award selection committee wrote:
                    <p class = "italic">
                        <i>
                            The success of the UNIX system stems from its tasteful selection of a few key ideas and their elegant implementation. The model of the Unix system has led a generation of software designers to new ways of thinking about programming. The genius of the Unix system is its framework, which enables programmers to stand on the work of others.
